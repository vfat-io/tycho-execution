# How to deploy

- Install dependencies `npm install`
- `cd foundry`

## Deploy on a Tenderly fork

1. Make a new [fork](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/) in tenderly dashboard for the
   chain that you wish to deploy on.
2. Set the following environment variables:

```
export RPC_URL=<fork-rpc-from-tenderly>
export DEPLOY_WALLET=<wallet-address>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key>
```

3. Fund wallet: `npx hardhat run scripts/fund-wallet-tenderly-fork.js --network tenderly`

## Deploy on Ethereum Mainnet or Base

1. Set the following environment variables:

```
export RPC_URL=<chain-rpc-url>
export DEPLOY_WALLET=<wallet-address>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key>
export BLOCKCHAIN_EXPLORER_API_KEY=<blockchain-explorer-api-key>
```

Make sure to run `unset HISTFILE` in your terminal before setting the private key. This will prevent the private key
from being stored in the shell history.

## Deploy Tycho Router

For each of the following, you must select one of `tenderly_ethereum`, `tenderly_base`,
`ethereum`, or `base` as the network.

1. Deploy router: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-router.js --network NETWORK`
2. Define the accounts to grant roles to in `scripts/roles.json`
3. Export the router address to the environment variable `export ROUTER_ADDRESS=<router-address>`
4. Grant roles: `npx hardhat run scripts/set-roles.js --network NETWORK`
5. Set executors: `npx hardhat run scripts/set-executors.js --network NETWORK`. Make sure you change the
   DEPLOY_WALLET to the executor deployer wallet. If you need to deploy executors, follow the instructions below.

### Deploy executors

1. In `scripts/deploy-executors.js` define the executors to be deployed
2. Deploy executors: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-executors.js --network NETWORK`
3. Fill in the executor addresses in `config/executor_addresses.json`
